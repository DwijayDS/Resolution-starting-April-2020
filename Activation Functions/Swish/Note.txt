 More complicated functions performed worse than simpler functions. 

Other functions that were discovered by the search that we found interesting are

f(x) = cos(x)âˆ’x

and

f(x) =max(x,tanh(x)). 

However, these activation functions did not generalize as well as Swish in our experiments,so we did not pursue them further.
